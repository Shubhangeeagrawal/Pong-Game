# Pong-Game
The Pong game is a classic arcade-style game that simulates table tennis. The objective is for players (or a player vs. computer) to bounce a ball back and forth using paddles without letting the ball go past them. This project serves as an excellent introduction to game development and graphical programming in Java using the Swing framework.
